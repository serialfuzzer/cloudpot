**open_directory.js**

Publish an open-directory like honeypot to your website. Anyone who opens the website will get their IP sent to discord channel via webhooks. There's also a secret message endpoint in the code. 
This is bad for crawlers as some of them continuosly try to traverse the never-ending list of directories.  Example instance: suyogyakhanal.com.np

The script will send IP address of the viewer and what path they were trying to visit like shown in the photo below. Note that the IP addresses has been blacked out to privacy reasons. I don't hold responsibility if someone uses this in regions where grabbing IP address is not allowed, as this is just for educational and testing purpose.
